          <h4>WORK AND PROJECTS</h4>
          <p>I’ve been building commercial software for 17 years. I’ve made it a priority to understand and be involved in all the processes involved in building exceptional software. I’ve built platforms, mobile applications and hardware solutions and consulted for both small agencies and larger enterprises.</p> 
          <p>My background includes founding and running a custom software development studio for a decade. The studio specialised in the development of software products and platforms which included web, mobile, desktop and IoT applications. A diverse range of clients and industries included early-stage startups, financial services, loyalty and e-commerce companies.  The studio no longer actively develops software and now only oversees products it is invested in.  </p>
          <p>As an owner of a software studio, I wore many hats.  I hired, scaled and worked with remote development teams both for the studio and for clients hiring in-house teams. Projects at the studio were often high-stake, complex, multi-stakeholder projects. As a result, I’m used to working with and managing an array of people - from freelancers, contractors, digital agencies, large enterprises, third-party software providers to a host of service providers.  You can take a look at the projects I was involved with here.  </p>
          <p>I enjoy sharing my stories and expertise and now work as an outsource CTO and product developer.  To see what I’m up to right now, <a href="#" target="_blank">go here</a>. </p>

          <h4>TESTIMONIALS</h4>
          <p>We have extensively worked with Sean while building IndieMaker. He planned the build, chose the infrstracuture, created and implemented development best practices, built the platform and hired tech talent. He’s also done an amazing job with security and managing fraud. Working with an outsource CTO has been one of the best decisions we ever made and gave us access to input we would not otherwise afford.</p>
